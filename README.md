# OpenAI-Language-App
An OpenAI based language app. Built using Bootstrap, Node.js, and OpenAI API.

# Description
The app is inspired by Duolingo and helps language learners by generating matching challenges with words or sentences of their chosen language. The user can pick any topic they want to generate challenges for. If there are any questions about the app, you can reach me at 13hy22@queensu.ca.

# Install and Run The Project
After cloning the repository, go to the folder and use `npm install` to install packages.
Then use `npm run index.js` to run the app locally, but note that you will need to input your own OpenAI API key for it to work.

# Other Notes
I am open to updating this project if anyone has any issues/desired functionality not already in it. Please feel free to fork and build what you want from it too.
